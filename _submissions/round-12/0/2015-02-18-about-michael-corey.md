I grew up outside Pittsburgh, PA. I did my undergraduate work in technical theater and worked as a professional stagehand 
before going to graduate school for sociology. I have done graduate level sociology at the LSE, Oxford, and the University 
of Chicago (which I will one day finish). I'm currently a 
[Population Scientist @ Facebook](https://research.facebook.com/researchers/492929580849287/michael-r-corey/), where I 
work on the [internet.org](http://www.internet.org) project and internal survey tools. 

In my free time I watch cartoons with my 16-month old son, wife, and 2 cats. I also lecture about permeating the barrier 
between the formal social sciences and industry.

My biggest struggle with git is remembering when to commit and when to amend!
